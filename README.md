This web application lets you explore the Mobile Device Usage dataset by Vala Khorasani (hosted at www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset.) The application is divided into two main parts, a sidebar on the left and the main panel on the right. The main panel is used to select the analysis or plot type and adjust its visual appearance. The main panel itself is divided into 3 pages: the About tab gives general information about the application; the Data Download tab shows the current raw data (including any subsets) as a table and lets you download it as a CSV file; and the Data Exploration tab is dedicated to exploring the data with numeric summaries, plots, and tables. Individual types of plots and summaries are included as subpages of the Data Exploration page. These include contingency tables for one or two categorical variables, statistical summaries for individual numeric variables, a correlation matrix of all numeric variables, scatterplots, boxplots, and density scatterplots. The left side panel is for choosing which variables to summarize: select numeric variables and subset them by range, or select categorical variables and subset them by any combination of their values.
